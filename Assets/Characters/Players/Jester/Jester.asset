  name: Jester The Jester
  description: "Jester The Jester was once a jester in a noble\u2019s court, where
    his quick wit and charm kept the lord\u2019s spirits high. But a cruel twist
    of fate left him homeless after the lord\u2019s sudden death, with the court
    dissolving and his life thrown into uncertainty. Now, wandering the land, Jester
    uses his talents to aid those in need, relying on chance to guide his survival.
    His ability to bring joy or despair depends on the whims of fate, and he clings
    to the hope that, someday, his luck will turn and offer him a purpose once more. "
