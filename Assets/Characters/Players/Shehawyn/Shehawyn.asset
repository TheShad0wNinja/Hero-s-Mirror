  description: 'He was a Paladin who devoted his entire life to the temple, dedicating
    his every action to his faith. Having spent most of his years within its hallowed
    walls, he had never encountered the world beyond, knowing only the fellowship
    of his fellow knights and the enemies he fought to protect the temple. His existence
    was one of solitude and duty, bound by sacred oaths and unyielding devotion,
    with no room for the outside world or its complexities. '
